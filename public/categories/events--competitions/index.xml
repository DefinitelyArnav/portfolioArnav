      <description>(Disclaimer: The data used for this application is synthetic. I’ve used London city’s data and modified it by randomly attaching districts, geolocation, victim_age etc. The crime records reported in the application are in no way related to Assam.)
During the Smart India Hackathon 2018, I got a chance to make an interactive ‘Crime Mapper and Spatial data analytics tool’. My team, Six Sigma, named it ‘SATARK’.
The code is entirely written in R and I’ve used R’s ‘Shiny’ package to build it into an interactive app.</description>
