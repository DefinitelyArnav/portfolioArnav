<p>Satark is a digital crime recording and analytics web application built for performing real time spatial data analysis on crime data to help the police personnels identify crime hotspots and prevailing crime trends. The application was conceived as a solution to the problem statement of crime mapping offered by the Govt of Assam during the Smart India Hackathon ’18. <br></br> It composed of three major components</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A database management system for recording geospatial crime data built using postgreSQL.</li>
<li>A digital crime mapper and analytics tool to give the police officials a comprehensive overview of the crime trends prevailing in the geographical area under their jurisdiction, built using R and Shiny framework.</li>
<li>‘Satark Nagrik App’, a mobile application for crowdsourcing crime reports. The citizens could report crime incidents through this app which would be updated in real time on a geographical map. <br></br> The application could also be made available for general public so as to make them aware of the crime statistics prevailing in their neighbourhood</li>
