# Biography
Hi says this data freak!<br></br>
In my freshmen year, I developed this fascination for data and it's ability to hide amazing stories within itself. My engineering coursework further aligned with this interest of mine and thus began my tryst with data and data sciences.<br></br>
I have worked on a handful of data science related projects and contests employing my proficiency in R/Python, machine learning algorithms and probability and statistics. Further, I would be joining Deloitte USI as a Data Science Intern this summer.
